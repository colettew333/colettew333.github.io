<h1>Food Marriage of nature and culture</h1>
<p>From earliest times, man—like every other species on the
planet—has interacted with nature according to one overriding
imperative: survival. For a very long time, this imperative was
based not only on the need to protect himself from what, at
times, were highly adverse environmental conditions, but
above all, on his ability to win the challenge of eating or being
eaten. The modern-day film industry has often allowed us to
experience the anxiety of these primordial times. Wandering
in search of food since the dawn of time, man has placed his
survival in two practical principles: the gathering of anything
edible and hunting. According to a leading human ethologist,
“man has lived as a hunter-gatherer for 99 percent of his history,
and this may also have shaped him biologically” Whether
gathering fruit from a tree or killing his prey, man’s relationship
with the environment around him has always been based on
transforming it.</p>
<p>Continuously exposed to the threat of becoming food
themselves, our ancestors developed an increasingly
sophisticated approach to nature, way before the advent of
agriculture approximately 15,000 years ago. The major phases
in this process are well known. In the Paleolithic Age, man had
already discovered and begun to use fire. During the same
period, he created a growing number of tools—first in stone
and later in metal—for hunting, fishing, defense and building
shelter. Physically ill-equipped compared with other animals,
the hunter-gatherer did have significant mental resources and
tremendous curiosity.</p>
<p>In some hunter-gatherer populations, the diet was
significantly based on game and, as a result, on meat
consumption. This is true even in modern-day hunter-gatherer
populations in the arctic and sub-arctic regions where there
is very little else to eat. But the majority of contemporary
experts believe that most hunter-gatherers of the past lived
predominantly on foods derived from plants or—in areas near
the sea and rivers—fish and shellfish. Some population were
almost exclusively vegetarian.</p>
<p>During the Paleolithic era, Homo erectus was replaced
by Homo sapiens, and the size of the brain expanded from
approx. 400 cubic centimeters to the current 1400 cubic
centimeters. A large brain requires an extraordinary amount
of nutrients. However, Anderson challenges the theory that
this is an explanation for the drive to hunt and eat meat, given
the inadequate presence of teeth and claws on man and the
questionable efficiency of primitive hunting instruments. He
has another explanation for the interconnection between
the brain and diet:</p>
<p>“In my view, the only credible theory of the evolution of the
human diet is that the first hominids continued to improve as
omnivores. They improved in finding meat, looking for carrion
and hunting, but also in finding roots, seeds, sprouts, eggs and
anything else edible. […] The only way in which an animal with
a large and demanding brain could survive is by using that brain
for thinking about how to utilize a vast range of good foods to
obtain maximum nutrition with least effort” (Anderson, 2005).</p>
<p>As a result, man’s first “cultural” efforts largely involved the
issue of how to find food and open the way for his extraordinary
omnivorous drive. Pollan, in his well-known work, The
Omnivore’s Dilemma, is in full agreement with this. Other animals,
notes Pollan, follow the opposite strategy, that of a highly-selective
diet and, in line with this, have very small brains.
The koala is an extreme case. If this animal has a notoriously
small brain, it is because “a large quantity of cerebral circuitry
is not needed to imagine what’s for dinner when the only thing
someone eats are eucalyptus leaves”3. The koala is thus free of
the anxiety of omnivores in searching out alternative foods
(its only problem is, if the eucalyptus forest disappears, it will
die). The situation with man is radically different since, as Pollan
observes, he must dedicate an enormous amount of mental
energy to hone the cognitive and sensory tools needed to
distinguish which foods, among the many available, are safe
to eat. This effort is, in fact, an essential part of the cultural
process and will be discussed later on.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the discovery of fire marked a major step in
man’s ability to manipulate nature. Used alternately for heat,
light, protection from wild beasts, send messages and dry
clothing, fire made possible progressive cultural developments
that were enormously important, especially in terms of diet.
For Levi Strauss, cooking food using fire is “the invention which
made human beings human”. Before learning about cooking,
food (and especially meat) was eaten raw, spoiled or rotten.
The use of fire brought about a decisive change. In Levi Strauss’ structuralist approach, cooking symbolically marks a transition
from nature to culture, and also from nature to society, given
that while raw is natural in origin, cooked implies a step that is
both cultural and social4. </p>
<p>Food as a stimulus to primordial communication<br>
Whether structured as a language or not, food had a very
important role in the development of the earliest forms of
human communication. When, simultaneously with the
growth in the human brain, social groups tended to grow in
size—from around 20 members in groups during the Homo
erectus era to around 50-150 members in groups during that of
Homo sapiens—the amount of territory controlled by the group
also grew. Over a larger territory, the discovery of a food source
had to be communicated in more detail to explain where it was
and how many members of the group could be fed. This is,
unquestionably, one of the ways in which language developed also underscores that at the root of language
was the need for territorial control tied to food, together with
the desire to maintain social ties, given that man is the only
primate which, in order to hunt, leaves his own group for long
periods of time.</p>
<p>Language may also have been developed to reduce tension
connected with the division of food. As recently noted by
Jones, at the origin of what we today call conviviality was the
primitive practice of sharing food around the fire by groups of
human beings who sat face-to-face, smiling, laughing—and,
with time, conversing. These practices were not found among
other species, not only because of their fear of fire, but because
within the animal kingdom, direct eye contact, opening the
mouth and showing teeth are typically hostile gestures. “If this
is added to the fact of placing food right in the middle of a group
of individuals, other than a parent and child, there is a clear recipe
for conflict and violence.” The ability to be able to communicate
must have had a major role and it, in turn, was stimulated in
those rites of sharing with which our ancestors were able to
overturn the signs of danger and transform them into the very
essence of conviviality that defines the human condition. The
contemporary table and the practice of mixing food and talk
under all sorts of convivial circumstances thus derives from a
very ancient experience in which the human race overcame
natural instincts of tension and moved a number of rungs up
the ladder of cultural and social development.</p>
