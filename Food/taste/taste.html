<body><h2>HOW THE BRAIN CONSTRUCTS FLAVOR </h2><p>The tongue detects basic tastes, but the nose—with hundreds of receptors for chemicals that waft off food—contributes more to flavor. According to neurobiologist Gordon Shepherd, the brain draws on all the senses to assemble a complex “flavor image” that lingers in our memory. Taste receptors alone don’t produce tastes; they have to be connected to taste centers in the brain. In recent decades scientists have discovered receptors identical to some of those on the tongue in other parts of the body, including the pancreas, intestines, lungs, and testes. We don’t “taste” anything with them, but if, for example, we inhale certain undesirable substances, the bitter receptors in our lungs send a signal to our brains, and we cough.</p>

<p>As animal species have evolved, they’ve sometimes lost tastes that their ancestors possessed. Cats and many other obligate carnivores, which eat only meat, can no longer detect sugars. (When cats lap milk, they’re responding to something else—probably fat.) Most whales and dolphins, which swallow prey whole, have lost almost all taste receptors.</p>

<p>Something similar may have happened in humans. At Monell a scientist named Michael Tordoff handed me a plastic medicine cup containing a clear liquid and asked me to drink it. It tasted like water. He said, “You didn’t taste much of anything, but this is something that rats and mice prefer to almost everything else we have ever, ever tested. If you give a rat a bottle of this and a bottle of sugar, it will drink more of this.” The liquid contained maltodextrin, a kind of starch that’s a common ingredient in sports drinks. If a human athlete takes a mouthful of maltodextrin solution and immediately spits it out, Tordoff said, the athlete will perform better, despite having tasted and ingested nothing or next to nothing. “I don’t have a good explanation,” he continued. “There’s something very special about starch that we don’t understand. It may be there’s a separate receptor for it or one specifically for maltodextrin. But the receptor is no longer plumbed into the conscious parts of the brain.”</p>

<p>ALTHOUGH THE TONGUE MAP doesn’t exist, there may be a taste map in the brain. A region called the gustatory cortex has been reported to contain clusters of neurons that are specialized to respond to individual basic tastes. Signals from the tongue reach them after passing through the brain stem, and in the gustatory cortex, or maybe along the way, they become part of a complex and only partially understood experience that we commonly call taste but should really call flavor. Linda Bartoshuk told me that only a small part of our experience of food comes from our taste buds. The rest is really the result of a kind of backward smelling.</p>

<p>You can demonstrate this to yourself with candy. If you pinch your nose shut and chew, say, an anonymous-looking white jelly bean, your tongue will register immediately that it’s sweet. That sweetness comes from sugar, and it’s the jelly bean’s primary taste. Let go of your nose, though, and you’ll immediately perceive the flavor: Ah, vanilla. Conversely, if you pinch your nose shut and put a drop of vanilla on your tongue, you won’t taste anything, because vanilla has no taste—only a flavor you can’t detect with a pinched nose.</p>

<p>When we chew, swallow, and exhale, Bartoshuk explained, “volatile molecules from the food are forced up behind our palate and into our nasal cavity from the back,” like smoke going up a chimney. In the nasal cavity they bind with odor receptors—and it’s those receptors, of which humans have somewhere between 350 and 400 types, that are the main source of what we perceive as flavor. That’s different from taste, which is the sensation derived from our taste buds, and it’s also different from ordinary smelling, because the brain distinguishes between odors we sniff through our nostrils (orthonasal olfaction) and odors that reach our nasal cavity from behind as we eat (retronasal olfaction)—even though the same receptors detect both.
“The brain pays attention to whether you’re sniffing or chewing and swallowing,” Bartoshuk continued, “and it doesn’t treat those signals the same. Odor information from retronasal olfaction goes to a different part of the brain—the one that also receives information from the tongue. The brain combines retronasal olfaction and taste, creating what we call flavor, although the rules of integration are not well-known.”</p>

<p>Jelly beans can be props for another trick too, Bartoshuk said. Releasing your nostrils when you’re chewing one doesn’t just tell you what the flavor is; it also makes the jelly bean taste sweeter—an effect that’s not caused by sugar, which contains no volatiles and therefore has no effect on smell receptors. The explanation, she said, is that other ingredients of a jelly bean contain volatile molecules that somehow “enhance the sweet message,” making the brain think the jelly bean contains more sugar than it does. Such sweetness enhancers are common in fruits, maybe because producing them costs less energy than producing sugar and yet they’re just as effective at attracting insects and other pollinators and seed dispersers. “Strawberries have something like 30 volatiles that enhance sweet,” Bartosuk said, “and when you put all the signals together, you realize that a substantial amount of the sweetness is coming from their interaction in the brain.”</p>

<p>In addition to her duties at Mattson, Stuckey teaches a course at the San Francisco Cooking School called “The Fundamentals of Taste.” “Most culinary schools don’t teach students how to taste before they start to cook,” she said. “They jump right in with, like, knife skills. But how can you possibly start an education around food without the building blocks of flavor?” She and her students do an exercise in which they make barbecue sauce. Most of the ingredients she provides are ones you would guess: tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar, honey, liquid smoke, paprika. But there’s also a tray of ingredients whose predominant taste is bitter: coffee, cocoa, tea, bitters. “It’s not really intuitive, because you don’t think of barbecue sauce as bitter, but if you taste it before and after you add a bitter ingredient, you realize that bitter changes the whole gestalt. It adds a complexifying note.” At home Stuckey uses soluble espresso—instant coffee—as a bitter complexifier for many dishes, and especially for sweet or sweetish sauces.</p>

<p>Mattson’s research laboratories contain a lot of high-tech testing equipment, but in one of them I met three researchers who were chewing thoughtfully and staring into plastic cups. A food manufacturer had hired Mattson to replicate a spicy brown-rice dish sold by one of its competitors, and chemical analysis could take the folks in white lab coats only so far. “The human palate is the most sophisticated analytical device there is,” Stuckey said. “You have to put it in your mouth.”</p>
