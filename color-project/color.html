	<h2>Theory of Color</h2>
	<p>Three basic categories of color theory: The color wheel, color harmony, and the context of how colors are used. Color theories create a logical structure for color.</p>
	<h3>Primary - any of a group of colors from which all other colors can be obtained by mixing.</h3>
	<h3>Secondary - cyan, magenta and yellow</h3>
	<h3>Tertiary - combinations of primary and secondary colours. </h3>

<section id="models">
	<h2>Color Models</h2>
	<p>Used to classify colors and to qualify them according to such attributes as hue, saturation, chroma, lightness, or brightness</p>
	<h3>Analogous</h3>
	<p>colors that sit next to each other on the color wheel</p>
	<h3>Monochromatic</h3>
	<p>all the colors (tints, tones, and shades) of a single hue</p>
	<h3>Triadic</h3>
	<p>One color to dominate, a second to support and the third color is used as an accent. A triadic color scheme uses colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel</p>
	<h3>Complementary</h3>
	<p>pairs of colors which, when combined, cancel each other out</p>
