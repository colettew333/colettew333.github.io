<h4>Aesop was an Ancient Greek fabulist or story teller credited with a number of fables <br>now collectively known as Aesop's Fables. Although his existence remains uncertain and no <br>writings by him survive, numerous tales credited to him were gathered across the centuries and <br>in many languages in a storytelling tradition that continues to this day. Many of the tales are characterized by<br> animals and inanimate objects that speak, solve problems, and generally have human characteristics.</h4>
